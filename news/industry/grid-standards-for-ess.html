<h3>Distributor's Review & Application Insight</h3>
<p><strong>FAE Insight:</strong> When switching frequency and efficiency are paramount, the 2FSC0110 is the core to use. Its extremely low propagation delay and high Common-Mode Transient Immunity (CMTI) are essential for reliably driving SiC MOSFETs at hundreds of kilohertz. We see this core being designed into high-power-density applications like onboard EV chargers, server power supplies, and solar microinverters. It provides the core performance needed to truly take advantage of SiC technology.</p>

<!-- FAQ Tab -->
<div class="faq-item"><h4><strong>Q:</strong> Why is high CMTI so important for SiC drivers?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> SiC MOSFETs switch extremely fast, creating very high dv/dt (voltage change over time). This can induce noise across the isolation barrier, potentially corrupting the PWM signal and causing catastrophic failure. A driver with high CMTI, like the 2FSC0110, can withstand this noise and maintain stable operation.</p></div>
