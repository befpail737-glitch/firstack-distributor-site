<div class="faq-item"><h4><strong>Q:</strong> What is the primary difference between this and the 2FHD0620?</h4><p><strong>A:</strong> The 2FHD0115C is designed for IGBTs, has a lower peak current (15A vs 20A), and uses an electrical interface. The 2FHD0620 is specifically for SiC modules, has a higher peak current, different gate voltages (+20V/-5V), and a fiber optic interface for superior noise immunity.</p></div>
